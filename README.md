Have you ever needed help planning a night out with your significant other?  Well this site will help!  With this app you can search for movies near your location or you can specify a zip code. Based on how far you’re willing to drive, the app will show what movies are playing, at what theater, and the show times. Once you’ve made your choices, you can go ahead and buy your tickets.  If you also want a bite to eat, you can search for a restaurant as well. Just tell the app what food you’re in the mood for and it will give you a list of restaurants close to the theater.  That way you don’t need to drive across town, get stuck in traffic, and be late for the movie!
